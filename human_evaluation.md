# Human Evaluation Data

The raw (anonymized) human evaluations we obtained can be downloaded 
[in this csv file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1doC-NjhUlt4YDnK1qm23tyrfbogVlZ29/view?usp=sharing). 

The columns are: 
- `HITId`: Integer indexing the row 
- `WorkerId`: Unique identifier of the crowd-worker 
- `WorkTimeInSeconds`: Amount of time the HIT was open on AMT
- `Input.idx`: Index of the prompt 
- `Input.ctx`: Context/prompt that each completion is based upon
- `Input.model_a`: Name of player A
- `Input.completiona`: Completion generated by player A
- `Input.len_a`: Total length (prompt + generation) of player A's text
- `Input.model_b`: Name of player B
- `Input.completionb`: Completion generated by player B
- `Input.len_b`: Total length (prompt + generation) of player B's text
- `Answer.q1`:  Answer of crowd-worker to the question: "Which continuation is more interesting or creative, given the context?"
- `Answer.q2`: Answer of crowd-worker to the question: "Which continuation makes more sense, given the context?"
- `Answer.q3`: Answer of crowd-worker to the question: "Which continuation is more likely to be written by a human?" 
- `Answer.te`: Our (pessimistic) estimate of the amount of time the crowd-worker took to answer the question.


Key to `Answer.q*` fields: The responses of the crowd-workers to each question is stored with the following key: 
- Definitely A: 2a
- Slightly A: 1a
- Tie: 1a 
- Slightly B: 1b
- Definitely B: 2b

Note that both "Tie" and "Slightly A" are recorded as `1a`. Since for each pair, the choice of A versus B is randomized, this amounts to randomly assigning each tie as a win to one of the two players.
